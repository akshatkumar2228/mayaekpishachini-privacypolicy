Privacy Policy for Maya: Ek Pishachini

Effective Date: February 19, 2026
Organization: Akshat Softwares

Akshat Softwares ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled in connection with the mobile game Maya: Ek Pishachini (the “Game”). By downloading or using the Game, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect
No Direct Personal Data Collection

Akshat Softwares does not collect, store, or share personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location through the Game.

No User Accounts: The Game does not require account creation.

No Developer Analytics: We do not use analytics services to track player behavior for our own purposes.

The Game may store limited data locally on your device (such as game progress or settings). This data remains on your device and is removed if you uninstall or clear the app’s data.

2. Third-Party Data Collection and Advertising

While Akshat Softwares does not collect personal data directly, third-party services integrated into the Game may collect information as necessary to provide advertising, measure performance, and prevent fraud.

Advertising and Consent Management (UMP)

To keep the Game free to play, we display advertisements using third-party ad services. We use the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to manage user consent and comply with privacy regulations.

Depending on your region (including the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or certain U.S. states), you may be shown a consent dialog when launching the Game. You may:

Accept personalized ads

Decline personalized ads

Manage privacy preferences

You can modify your choices later through your device settings or in-game options (where available).

Ad Mediation (LevelPlay)

The Game uses LevelPlay (by ironSource) mediation to serve ads from multiple advertising partners, including:

Unity Ads

ironSource Ads

Google AdMob

These advertising partners may automatically collect certain information, including:

Android Advertising ID (AAID)

IP address

Device type and operating system

Approximate location derived from IP address

Ad interaction data (such as impressions and clicks)

This information is used to:

Deliver personalized or non-personalized advertisements

Limit ad frequency

Measure ad performance

Prevent fraud and abuse

Please review the privacy policies of these providers:

Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Unity Privacy Policy: https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy

ironSource Privacy Policy: https://www.is.com/privacy-policy/

Akshat Softwares does not control how these third parties collect or process data.

3. In-App Purchases

The Game offers optional in-app purchases processed through the Google Play Billing System.

Akshat Softwares does not access or store your credit card, banking, or payment information.

All payments are handled securely by Google Play.

We receive only purchase confirmation information required to unlock purchased content.

For more information, please review Google Play’s privacy practices.

4. Age Rating and Children’s Privacy

Maya: Ek Pishachini is intended for players aged 16 and older, consistent with its Play Store rating.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable by law). If you believe a child has provided personal data through third-party services within the Game, please contact us so appropriate steps can be taken.

5. Data Security

Because we do not collect or store personal data on our own servers, data security risks on our side are minimized. Third-party partners such as Google, Unity, and ironSource implement industry-standard security measures to protect the data they process.

However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure.

6. Data Retention

Akshat Softwares does not retain personal data. Any gameplay data stored locally remains on your device until you delete the Game or clear application data.

Third-party partners may retain data according to their own privacy policies.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When updates are made, the Effective Date at the top of this policy will be revised. Continued use of the Game after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
