<h1>Privacy Policy – Maya : Ek Pishachini</h1>

<div class="header-info">

    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Akshat Softwares</p>
</div>

<p>
Akshat Softwares ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled in connection with the mobile game

such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location through the Game.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The Game does not require account creation.</li>
    <li><strong>No Developer Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics services to track player behavior for our own purposes.</li>
</ul>

The Game may store limited data locally on your device (such as game progress or settings).
This data remains on your device and is removed if you uninstall or clear the app’s data.
</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Data Collection and Advertising</h2>

<p>
While Akshat Softwares does not collect personal data directly, third-party services integrated
into the Game may collect information as necessary to provide advertising, measure performance,
and prevent fraud.
</p>

<h3>Advertising and Consent Management (UMP)</h3>

<p>
To keep the Game free to play, we display advertisements using third-party ad services.
We use the <strong>Google User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> SDK to manage user consent
and comply with privacy regulations.
</p>

<p>
Depending on your region (including the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or certain U.S.
states), you may be shown a consent dialog when launching the Game. You may:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Accept personalized ads</li>
    <li>Decline personalized ads</li>
    <li>Manage privacy preferences</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can modify your choices later through your device settings or in-game options (where available).
</p>

<h3>Ad Mediation (LevelPlay)</h3>

<p>
The Game uses <strong>LevelPlay (by ironSource)</strong> mediation to serve ads from multiple
advertising partners, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unity Ads</li>
    <li>ironSource Ads</li>
    <li>Google AdMob</li>
</ul>

<p>These advertising partners may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Android Advertising ID (AAID)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
    <li>Approximate location derived from IP address</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data (such as impressions and clicks)</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is used to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deliver personalized or non-personalized advertisements</li>
    <li>Limit ad frequency</li>
    <li>Measure ad performance</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>

    <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.is.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">ironSource Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Akshat Softwares does not control how these third parties collect or process data.
</p>

<h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>
The Game offers optional in-app purchases processed through the
<strong>Google Play Billing System</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Akshat Softwares does <strong>not</strong> access or store your credit card or banking information.</li>
    <li>All payments are handled securely by Google Play.</li>

</p>

<h2>4. Age Rating and Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
<strong>Maya: Ek Pishachini</strong> is intended for players aged <strong>16 and older</strong>,
consistent with its Play Store rating.
</p>

<p>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13
(or 16 where applicable by law). If you believe a child has provided personal data
through third-party services within the Game, please contact us so appropriate steps
can be taken.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>

<p>
Because we do not collect or store personal data on our own servers, data security risks
on our side are minimized. Third-party partners such as Google, Unity, and ironSource
implement industry-standard security measures to protect the data they process.
</p>

<p>
However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>

<p>
Akshat Softwares does not retain personal data. Any gameplay data stored locally remains
on your device until you delete the Game or clear application data.
</p>

<p>
Third-party partners may retain data according to their own privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When updates are made, the
<strong>Effective Date</strong> at the top of this policy will be revised.
Continued use of the Game after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
